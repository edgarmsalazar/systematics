# systematics
Code developed in python to process systematics data bases.

The code is organized as follows:
- packages.py contains all packages used
- functions.py has all the functions used in the other files
- subroutines.py are user defined functions meant to be called from a main file
- main.py is the main file.

Code was running smooth over a month ago. Changes will be made to this code upon request and after testing. Changes will be made in the packages.py functions.py and subroutines.py files only. The main file is intended to be modified by the user.

In the next days I'll be uploading a "How to guide" to use Healpix (request made by Tom a couple of weeks ago)
